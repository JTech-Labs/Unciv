# How can I contribute?
So you want to help the Unciv project? Here are a few resources to get started contributing! Most of the details are in the [Documentation](https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/).
There are some direct links to specific sections further down in this document.

The most valuable first step to getting involved is engaging with our community: join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/bjrB4Xw)! It's a great place to meet your fellow contributors.

In addition, you can keep track of requests, bugs, and our todo list for the application at the repository's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/issues).

If you're a developer, you'll probably want to start at the [Getting Started](https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Developers/Building-Locally/) page!

If you're a translator, head over to [Translating](https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Other/Translating/)!

If you're a modder, start [here](https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Modders/Mods/)!

If not, you can still help by spreading the word - vote for Unciv where you can, mention it on Reddit or Twitter etc, and help us with new ideas of how to get the word out!
